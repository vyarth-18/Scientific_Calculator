# 🧪 Scientific Calculator

Welcome to your nerdy little number-crunching friend! 🤓  
This is a **Scientific Calculator** built with good ol' **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** – no libraries, no frameworks, just pure brainpower and browser magic.

## 🎉 What It Can Do

This calculator isn’t just about `2 + 2 = 4` — it’s got *skills*:

✅ Basic math: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`  
📐 Trig functions: `sin`, `cos`, `tan`, etc.  
🔢 Powers and roots: `x²`, `√x`, `x^y`  
🧮 Logs and natural logs: `log`, `ln`

## ⚙️ How to Use It

1. **Clone this bad boy**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/scientific-calculator.git
   cd scientific-calculator
   ```

2. **Double-click `index.html`**  
   Or right-click → Open With → Your Favorite Browser.  
   Boom, you're calculating.

## 🧠 Under the Hood

Everything’s powered by JavaScript and the mighty `Math` object.  
For example:

```js
Math.sin(angleInRadians);
Math.pow(base, exponent);
Math.log(number); // Natural log
```

The UI is handled with basic CSS and a bit of flexbox/fancy styling. No Bootstrap here, just raw, uncut styles.

## 💡 Future Plans (maybe)

- ✅ Dark mode (because eyes are important)
- ✅ History log of calculations
- ✅ Keyboard support (for the speed typers)
- ✅ More Easter eggs 👀

So yeah, go wild. Just don’t sell it and say you invented math.

## ✨ Fun Fact

The calculator doesn’t judge your math skills.  
Get that `cos(90)` wrong? It's fine. We’ve all been there.
