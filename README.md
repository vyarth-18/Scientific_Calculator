# Scientific Calculator

Hi

Forgot your calc at home?

Don't worry, we got you.

This solo project comprises of building a proficiency in basic, no-framework frontend development. I have come far, from shockingly and quite confusingly discovering that js dosn't give a shit about ';' to realizing the subtle art of '==' and '==='.

Underlining the flaws, this project covers the basic arithmatic but lacks in the more complex stuff that makes it "Scientific", which I will come back to in a later part of my life.

To clone it or to ~clone it?    

Lies in thy hands and in thy keyboard.
